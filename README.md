## Project Overview
We were assigned to Dynamic Defense Solutions, a colombian company who wants to understand the potential of renewable energy generation (mainly solar and wind) in different areas of the country. In order to achieve this, we set 3 main objectives in this project:
- Identify regions with energy generation potential from descriptive analysis of irradiance and wind speed data.
- Efficiently calculate and visualize energy generation results and identify temporal patterns that affect it.
- Implement predictive models of consumption and generation to project state or private investment opportunities and economic benefits for the inhabitants of the study region in a window of time.

## Dataset

We were provided with datas sets that contain weather information taken from meteorological stations associated to the company. The data sets contain meteorological records such as irradiance, wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, wind direction and pressure of every half hour since 1998.
